A WIP electronic satellite antenna desktop model

I saw this design on Pinshape, but due to seemingly permanent website issues the STLs seemed to be lost forever. I started to recreate this by inspecting photos of others prints in early 2021, but never got around to finishing. Eventually plan to finish the model and use something like an ESP32 for remote control.
